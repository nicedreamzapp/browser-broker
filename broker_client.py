"""Client for browser-broker. This is what agents import instead of touching CDP.

    from broker_client import lease

    with lease("yahoo-reaper", url="https://mail.yahoo.com", purpose="inbox sweep") as tab:
        tab.eval("document.title")

The context manager holds the lease, auto-renews it while you work, and releases
the tab when the block exits — including on an exception, which is the whole
point: a crashed agent must not strand a tab.

Never reach for cdp.Tab.find() from an agent again. find() lands you on whatever
tab happens to match, which may be the one the human is reading.
